# Bachelor Thesis concerning Active Brownian Spheres undergoing Phase Transitions

## How to use

After installing all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt` you can run the program.
There are two options for you:

- Generate data and show simulation
- Take existing data and show the simulation

Generating data and then showing the simulation is the default behaviour.
Therefore, you can run the program simply with `python main.py`.

If you just want to show some already generated data, you need to append *-s* or *--show*.
Consequently, your command will look like `python main.py --show`.
